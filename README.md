## Note

```
Since JSONPlaceholder is a faked API endpoint, the operations of Delete,
Update and Create, even implemented at the frontend, won't work as expected.
All the changes are made on the frontend won't be saved in the JSONPlaceholder database.
Those operations will work if a real API endpoint has been replaced.
```
